## MISC

### - Linked Files / Symbolic Links
> Symbolic links - like shortcuts in **Windows**, and aliases in **MacOS** - provide mechanism for referring to another file. <br>
> Symbolic links can be easily identified by using `ls -l`, and by using the `file` command.
```console
$ ls -l /usr/bin/awk
("-l" directing ls to use long listing format)

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 21 Jun  3  2021 /usr/bin/awk -> /etc/alternatives/awk
                                                    ^^
- The arrow means that /usr/bin/awk is not a regular file, instead
it is a symbolic link, that points to another file.
- In this case, /usr/bin/awk points to /etc/alternatives/awk

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ file /usr/bin/awk
/usr/bin/awk: symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/awk
(Determine the type of a file using the commando "file")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ file /etc/alternatives/awk
/etc/alternatives/awk: symbolic link to /usr/bin/gawk

- A symbolic link to /usr/bin/gawk, which is an ELF executable file

$ file /usr/bin/gawk
/usr/bin/gawk: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV),
dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2,
BuildID[sha1]=b863ebf57d3cc33d8e7fed3be0e0b5d235489b46, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ readlink -m /usr/bin/awk
(Reading symbolic link of /usr/bin/awk)

- The flag "-m" follows every symlink(symbolical link) in every component,
without requirements on components existance.
```
