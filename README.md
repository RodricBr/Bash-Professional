## MISC

### Linked files
```bash
$ ls -l /usr/bin/awk
("-l" directing ls to use long listing format)

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 21 Jun  3  2021 /usr/bin/awk -> /etc/alternatives/awk
                                                    ^^
- The arrow means that /usr/bin/awk is not a regular file, instead
it is a symbolic link, that points to another file.
- In this case, /usr/bin/awk points to /etc/alternatives/awk

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ file /usr/bin/awk
/usr/bin/awk: symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/awk
(Determine the type of a file using the commando "file")
                                                    
```
